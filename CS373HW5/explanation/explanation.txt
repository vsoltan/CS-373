I've attached a screenshot to follow along with this explanation. At the first level, there's a lighthouse that's rotating along with the light: level 1. There is also a boat rotating around the light house: level 2. There is a school of three fish that are rotating around the boat: level 3. For level 4, there is a flock of birds circling over the fish as well as a hunter bird that is trying to scoop one of them from the water.
